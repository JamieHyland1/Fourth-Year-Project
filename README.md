# A Simple Society - Game Theory

## Abstract

People in groups behave in different ways, some are cooperative and trusting others are
aggressive and deceptive. The task is to try to create a virtual society in which individuals
behave in different ways. Each has a different strategy, which may evolve as time goes on.
The individuals may learn and improve their behaviour to obtain greater rewards. What
strategy works out best in the long-run?
The aim of this project is to simulate a simple society using genetic algorithms and key
concepts found in Game Theory. The system simulates two types of agents, passive and
aggressive, and attempts to find the optimal scenario where the two can co-exist without
over population or extinction occurring.

## Motivation

Our motivation for the project was to learn how people in groups behave in different ways.
Some are cooperative and trusting, others are aggressive and deceptive. We wished to
research these different behaviours, with an emphasis on evolution. With not a lot of
knowledge of the topic we were very interested to see which strategies would work out best
in the long-run.
Both of us have an interest in gaming, specifically, computer gaming. Developing a
simulation in unity allowed us to take many aspects of building a game and add them to the
simulation. From our experience in our third year module, Human Computer Interaction, we
increased our interest in the design and implementation side of games.
We were interested in this project for the inherent split in the type of work. It was clear from
the beginning that we would be coding up this simulation in Unity, making use of different
coding methods and 3d models we would create in blender. However we also knew that the
analysis towards the end of the project would be almost if not as important.
